        <h1>Refund Guidelines</h1>
        <p>We want you to be confident in your purchase. If the product does not meet expectations, please review our
            process below.</p>

        <h3>Timeframe</h3>
        <p>You may request a return up to <strong>[INSERT_DAYS] days</strong> following the confirmed delivery date.</p>

        <h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
        <p>To qualify for a refund, items must remain in new, resellable condition with all original tags attached. A
            valid receipt or order number is required for processing.</p>

        <h3>Exclusions</h3>
        <p>For hygiene and safety reasons, we cannot accept returns on perishable goods, customized items, or personal
            care products unless they arrived damaged.</p>

        <h3>Return Logistics</h3>
        <p>Customers are responsible for arranging return postage. We recommend using a trackable service, as we cannot
            guarantee receipt of the returned package.</p>

        <h3>Initiating a Return</h3>
        <p>Please direct all return requests to <strong>[INSERT_EMAIL]</strong> with your order details.</p>
